"""
This module defines the interface for a tree node in a chess move selector.

The `ITreeNode` protocol represents a node in a tree structure used for selecting chess moves.
It provides properties and methods for accessing information about the node, such as its ID,
the chess board state, the half move count, the child nodes, and the parent nodes.

The `ITreeNode` protocol also defines methods for adding a parent node, generating a dot description
for visualization, checking if all legal moves have been generated, accessing the legal moves,
and checking if the game is over.

Note: This is an interface and should not be instantiated directly.
