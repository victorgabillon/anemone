# Trees

Tree utilities and data structures for the search pipeline.

## Key pieces

- `tree.py`: `Tree` container that tracks descendants, root nodes, and node
  counts.
- `descendants.py`: `Descendants` helpers for grouping nodes by depth.
- `factory.py`: `ValueTreeFactory` for building trees from states and node
  factories.
- `tree_visualization.py`: Graphviz helpers to visualize or dump tree data.
